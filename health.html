                            There is a big concern for our colonist will they be happy to eat the same food over and over again. There can be only one food for them to eat daily and they will have to eat it for the rest of their lives, or they can have the other option to have different foods every single week for the rest of their lives. They might be happy to eat the same foods repeatedly for a few months, but they are going to hate it after a few weeks, so a menu with different foods everyday will keep them happy and excited for the next meal.

                            The ISS has over 100 different meals for the astronauts to eat, so we will do the same but this colonist will be in space for the rest of their lives so the food selection should be changing every day and can’t repeat for a week this ensures variety of food for the colonist.

                            Exercise and fitness in space are crucial due to reduced gravity, loss of muscle mass, bone density loss, and cardiovascular deterioration. Workout machines that use advanced resistance devices like the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), treadmills with harnesses, cycle ergometers, and elastic bands for strength training, cardiovascular workouts, and flexibility exercises. Incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Research on the International Space Station (ISS) continues to inform effective protocols, ensuring astronauts' physical and mental well-being during extended space travel.

                            The foods that astronauts eat are about the same we eat on earth. they have over 100 meals such as vegetables, meat, candy, and condiments. They are required to have at least 3 meals a day and have a minimum of 2500 calories a day. There are some differences such as their food being packaged in air-tight bags, cans, and plastic bags, they are not allowed to bring things that are in a powdery state due to it floating around and getting into cracks and gaps which can damage many crucial things.

                        <p class="overview1">
                            Radiation protection is important to protect people from harmful rays, they are less harmful on Earth due to the atmosphere, and many planets don’t have atmospheres as strong as Earth or they don’t have one at all. A way to get around this is shields made from lead and polyethylene. There are not a lot of ways to counter this problem but research on the ISS is being done about different ways to counter this problem like a drug that can protect D.N.A from harmful radiation.

                            Many people are religious and in space that is no different so we have to find quiet places for them to pray, we can make little boxes for groups of people if they want to pray by themselves or with others they have options, these are going to be insulated with foam so they are quiet and people can shout or be loud like in a library, this also applies to people who also want to meditate and just want to cool down, these people don’t always need to use this boxes but if they want to they are free to use them.

                            There are many religions so there are many religious books, so everyone needs the book they use for their religion but there is a problem hard copies can run out if they are given out to more people and our goal is to live on Mars so more people will live due to this we can also have online-copies and hard-copies at the same time, there will be enough books and they can share it to others and they won’t run out.

                            People use fasting for weight loss and religious reasons and fasting starts or ends at different times these times can change due to them relying on the moon, stars, and the sun, but in space, it is different because you can’t tell if the moon’s up or if the sun has set down so what you can do is rely on normal g.m.t time and start and end your fasting around the normal time your fasting starts or ends on earth, it’s not reliable but it is one of the best one’s we have right now.

                            In space, celebrations are about the same but sometimes it can look different if you have hundreds of people if you hold concerts and competitions the buildings will have to be massive and that can be hard to do in space, so these celebrations might have to be broken down into smaller individual concerts or competitions another choice is not a lot of people are allowed to go.

                            Religious times and festivals in space need to adapt to the unique environment in space and no fixed day-night cycle. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is relied in space to mark the astronaut's point of origin, and to schedule daily prayers, and fasts. Muslims might align their five daily prayers with Mecca's time, and Christians might follow Earth-based calendars for holidays like Christmas and Easter. Special provisions, such as religious texts, symbols, and foods, are pre-arranged, and virtual communities facilitate participation in services and celebrations.

                            Exposure to microgravity on reproductive cells is not effective for fertility. Studies on rodents have shown that there was a decrease in fertility rate, differences in hormone production and potentially affecting reproductive organs. If Embryos are also exposed, they can start to develop differently and increase the risks of microgravity, there are many more defects of exposure to microgravity like bone health and psychological well-being.

People who go to ISS are first put into training to see if they can be kept sane for a certain amount of time and they know they have hired valuable people. To be kept sane for years they should have opportunities to talk to other people and interact with them like Facetime and virtual reality. Exercise is important to keep sane for a long time, it clears distress from our minds and gives us something else to think about. Regular check-ups should be kept routine to maintain health and sanity.

Putting in bright yellow tape to signal that they must be cautious and not hurt themselves while entering dangerous rooms you can put on suits to ensure safety and if they can be made less dangerous but still have their purpose you can cut down sharp edges if they have any.

                            there are a lot of dangerous things on a spacecraft and trying to make them less dangerous could make them less useful some things are meant to be dangerous, but people need to know that it is dangerous so how do we prevent it. Putting in bright yellow tape to signal that they must be cautious and not hurt themselves while entering dangerous rooms you can put on suits to ensure safety and if they can be made less dangerous but still have their purpose you can cut down sharp edges if they have any.

“A care plan should be an accurate description of the person needing care and what matters to them” (age space, n/a). The care plan should have all the things they need for their medical problems so they can easily be treated with the right medication. The care plan should have a medical portfolio of so even new people can learn about them and their past medical records.

                            An emergency kit for space must be designed to address the unique challenges of the environment. It should include essential items such as oxygen tanks, water, nutrient-dense food, first aid kits, fire suppression tools, and radiation shielding. Communication equipment, navigation tools, and emergency shelter. Personal protective equipment, including space suits, is important for protection against microgravity and hazardous materials. Psychological support resources, backup power, sanitation supplies, and emergency lighting must also be included to maintain crew morale and well-being. With comprehensive training, protocols, and backup systems in place, an effective emergency kit ensures the readiness of astronauts to respond swiftly and effectively to any unforeseen circumstances in space.

                            Keeping the air clean in space is super important for astronauts' health. Spacecraft have special systems to make sure there's enough oxygen and to clean out any bad stuff in the air. They always check the air to make sure it's good, and they have machines to fix it if it's not. They also recycle stuff like water and air to use it again. And when we explore other planets, we're careful not to bring any germs from Earth that could mess up the new places. So, making sure the air stays clean and safe is a big deal for space missions.

                            Emergency oxygen supplies in space are essential for ensuring the safety and survival of astronauts during missions. Spacecraft are equipped with various systems to provide oxygen in emergencies, including compressed oxygen tanks, regenerative life support systems that recycle oxygen, emergency oxygen masks, portable oxygen units, and backup systems. Astronauts undergo extensive training in emergency procedures to respond effectively to oxygen-related emergencies. These measures ensure that astronauts have access to oxygen in the event of cabin depressurization or other emergencies, mitigating risks and ensuring the success of space missions.

                            “the International Space Station relies on astronauts manually processing trash by placing it into bags then loading it onto a designated vehicle for short-term storage, which depending on the craft, returns the trash to Earth or burns up in the atmosphere.” (Sarah.D, 2018). This is one of the methods and this is good, but we will be burning the rubbish and using it for fuel or electricity to make the rubbish useful.
